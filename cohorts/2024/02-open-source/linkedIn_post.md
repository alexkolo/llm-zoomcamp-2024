ðŸš€**Exploring Open-Source LLMs: Wrapping Up Module 2 of the LLM Zoomcamp**ðŸš€

I've just finished the 2nd module of the **LLM Zoomcamp**.

This comprehensive course dives deep into the practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on building AI systems for real-world tasks. ðŸ§ 

**Module 2** was all about harnessing the power of open-source LLMs:

- Setting up environments with GPUs for efficient model training and inference
- Exploring open-source models from the HuggingFace Hub
- Running LLMs on CPUs with Ollama, making powerful models accessible without expensive hardware
- Creating user-friendly interfaces with Streamlit

This module was a deep dive into the flexibility and control that open-source LLMs offer, moving beyond proprietary APIs to customizable, cost-effective solutions.

One highlight was the hands-on experience with various open-source models like FLAN-T5, Phi 3 Mini, and Mistral-7B. Configuring these models and seeing their performance firsthand was very insightful. Additionally, integrating these models into a cohesive workflow using tools like Docker and Streamlit demonstrated the practical application of these powerful technologies.

Iâ€™m excited to leverage these new skills to build more robust and flexible AI solutions. If you're also exploring the hashtag#GenAI space, letâ€™s connect and share our experiences!

Special thanks to DataTalksClub and Alexey Grigorev for this valuable resource! Looking forward to diving into the next modules.
