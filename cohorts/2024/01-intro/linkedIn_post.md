ðŸš€**Deepening Expertise: Wrapping Up Module 1 of the LLM Zoomcamp**ðŸš€

I've just finished the 1st module of the **LLM Zoomcamp**.

This intensive course is all about diving deep into the practicalities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by building a Q&A system using LLMs for natural language understanding, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for context augmentation.ðŸŽ“

**Module 1** was a thorough refresher on the basics of NLP, LLMs, and RAG:

- text preprocessing, embedding, tokenization, and similarity search
- context search retrieval using ElasticSearch
- prompt building
- APIs of OpenAI and open-weights LLMs
- RAG architecture and flow
- Simple Q&A RAG build
It's been a great way to solidify some of these core concepts and get hands-on with the latest tools.

As many of you know, my work over the past years has been heavily focused on developing and deploying machine learning algorithms. This course is an extension of that journey, helping me stay on the cutting edge of the hashtag#AI space.

One thing that stood out during this module was the hands-on approach to integrating these tools into real-world applications. It's not just theory - it's making these models work under real-world constraints, which is something we all deal with on a daily basis.

I look forward to using these new skills to tackle some of the more complex data challenges we face. If you're also diving into hashtag#GenAI space, I'd love to connect and share ideas.

Special thanks to DataTalksClub and Alexey Grigorev for this valuable resource! Looking forward to the next modules.
